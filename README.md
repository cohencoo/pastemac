Text you've previously copied will populate your clipboard on Pastemac. Needing to copy/paste something from the past? Press `Option` + `V` to view your clipboard. This will temporarily show the Pastemac app at the bottom of your display.

Clicking any copied item inside your clipboard will automatically copy it to your OSX. Lastly use the default `Cmd` + `V` to paste it.
